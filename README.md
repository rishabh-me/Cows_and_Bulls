# Cows and Bulls
This project was initially developed in Java as part of the Computer Applications subject of ICSE 2013 exams.
It has now been recreated with some updates in the original code.

The computer generates a random 4 digit number. The user/ player must identify this number in 10 or less chances.
After every chance, hints are given in terms of 'cows' and 'bulls'.

##### cows - It means that a certain digit guessed is present in the generated number at another position as guess by the user.

##### bulls - It means that the digit is guessed correctly and at the right position as well.


The hints are given in terms of number of cows and bulls in each chance.

### Happy Playing!!
